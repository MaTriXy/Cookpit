### It is safe to say that this techique to share code between Android and iOS is deprecated. I would recommend looking at other means to do this technique, e.g. Kotlin Mutliplatform Mobile etc. Some of my repositories also move towards using KMM instead.

# Cookpit
Flickr API implementation for Android/iOS with C++ core

## Requirement
* `python` (required for gyp)
* xcode & `xcodebuild`
* android ndk and `ndk-build` on your PATH to build for android
* Configure the paths to your [Android SDK](http://developer.android.com/sdk/installing/index.html)
  and [Android NDK](http://developer.android.com/tools/sdk/ndk/index.html) in your `local.properties`

## Installation
* Run `make lib` to build xcodeproj for shared library.
* Run `make ios` to build library for iOS project, located under ios/
* Run `make android` to trigger `ndk-build` for Android project, located under android/

## Building
* Running any `make` command will automatically download [gyp](https://code.google.com/p/gyp/) and create
`.xcodeproj` files suitable for developing on each platform.
* Please consult [iOS](https://github.com/kittinunf/Cookpit/blob/master/ios/README.md) and [Android](https://github.com/kittinunf/Cookpit/blob/master/android/README.md) folder for more detail on the application layer.

Make targets:
* `clean` - clean all generated files
* `ios` - build library name `libcookpit.a`, `libcookpit_ios.a` suitable for iOS
* `android` - build library name `libcookpit_android.so` suitable for Android

## Tools
* [gyp](https://code.google.com/p/gyp/) - generates xcode project to develop iOS and C++ (nobody likes adding files and configure project manually)
* [djinni](https://github.com/dropbox/djinni) - generates all bridging code for C++, Java, Objective-C/C++
